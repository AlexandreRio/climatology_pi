The data files needed for the program are obtained from various sources.

Wind and current data are compiled by programs in winddata and currentdata respectively.

I can only distribute the elnino_years data in git, the rest must be downloaded separately,
see separate folders for generating compiled data

weather.unisys.com has:
       tracks.bio  tracks.epa   tracks.bsh  tracks.nio
       tracks.atl tracks.bwp  tracks.she 
       tracks.spa.dat -- is concatination of all the files in that folder
