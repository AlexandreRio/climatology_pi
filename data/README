The data files needed for the program are obtained from various sources.

Wind and current data are compiled by programs in winddata and currentdata respectively.

I can only distribute the elnino_years data in git, the rest must be downloaded separately:

slpcoadsclim5079.nc -- sea level pressure
www.jisao.washington.edu/data/coads_climatologies/sstcoadsclim5079.nc

sstcoadsclim6079.1deg.nc -- sea surface temperature
www.jisao.washington.edu/data/coads_climatologies/sstcoadsclim6079.1deg.nc
